## The specification

This repository provides access to the ProcessEvents.xsd we are using and working on with a focus on mining interoperability. This repository is not the official repository for any other standards organisation.
The PorcessEvents.xsd should be used with the MESA B2MML schema's for implementing ISA95 integration projects.
